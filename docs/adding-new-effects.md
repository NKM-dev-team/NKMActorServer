## Adding new effects
### Add Metadata
- Add effect metadata on the `models/game/effect` path
- Add effect metadata in `CharacterEffectMetadatasProvider`
- Add related effect metadata to abilities the `models/game/abilities` path
### Implement Effects
- Add effect tests on the `unit/effects` path (optional, as often abilities test those effects)
- Implement effects and make unit tests green
